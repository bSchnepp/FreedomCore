This is a simple set of programs intended for eventually porting to the future Waypoint operating system. (which doesn't even have filesystems or memory management or ANYTHING useful yet!!! Just a dummy kernel ):!!! )

They're being developed and tested for Linux so that we can have _a_ userspace for Waypoint close to immediately.

Since Waypoint primarilly uses clang, these do as well. Install clang to build these.
