Do one (or a set of) thing(s) and do it *very* well, in ideally one C file and maybe a header.

The thing is, we don't mind too much if we have modules and complexity and all.
If a program can do related tasks as well, that's fine.
	(just don't make an init system with an integrated office suite + web browser :) )
Code style is just how I write. If it looks nice, let it be so. Just make sure the braces are on separate lines.

We use __tabs__ not spaces.
	TABS. TABS.	TABS. TABS.	TABS. TABS.	TABS. TABS.	TABS. TABS.
